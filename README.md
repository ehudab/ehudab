## 🚀 About Me

Hey! I’m Naod — a math student who’s completely fascinated by how **AI learns like humans do**.  
I love connecting math, logic, and code to understand how intelligent systems actually *think*.  

Right now, I’m learning the foundations of **machine learning**, **data analysis**, and **AI development** — and documenting everything I learn through small, hands-on projects here on GitHub.  

I believe in *learning by doing*, even if that means starting small and improving step by step. 🙌
